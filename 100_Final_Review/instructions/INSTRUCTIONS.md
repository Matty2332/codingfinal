##### Saturday, March 14th, 2020

</center>

# INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Turn off or silent your phone ;-)

1. `git clone` or `git pull` this repository to your computer.

1. Copy the Final Review folder over to your ACCSoftwareBootcamp group's personal repository, so you may edit the contents in your own repo, and be able to push them.  

    For example, get the questions from

    https://github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/Students_Sept_2019_Reviews/100_Final_Review

    And push your answers to

    https://github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/YOUR_GITHUB_HANDLE/finalReview

    
1. There's a folder for each question.  Please paste your answers within the respective folder.  

1. This review is in 3 parts

    1. **Multiple Choice questions**. These have equal weight and total upto 10% of the evaluation.

    2. **Small questions**.  These have equal weight and total upto 50% of the evaluation.

    3. **Practical portion**.  This is a project, similar to class project that has 40% of the evaluation.


1. This review is open book.  You may use all references available to you to answer the questions. You may ask instructors to point you in the right direction, if you are stuck. Think of this as a typical work environment, where you may ask a peer to show you the way, but not do the work for you. You may ask an instructor or mentor, but please refrain from asking anyone else.

1. If a code snippet on the review has a bug, please feel free to fix it and then answer. This is much like the real world.

1. Please git commit, git push your answers to your private ACCSoftwareBootcamp repository only.  Git push time stamps would be used to evaluate the answers of the appropriate committed version.


### INTEGRITY: 

Remember this final review is a test of how well prepared you are. You need a honest answer as much. Trying to bypass the process by copying answers, will not help with that goal. While some of the questions may appear difficult, they CAN be answered with some amount of research. It is more important to learn from this experience, than bypass it. As such, let us set some ground rules

- No sharing of direct or indirect answers.
- Absolutely no sharing of answer code.
- No sharing of url references, your peers can web search too ;-).
- Some of you may be asked to explain your answers after the review, if the answers are not clear.
- Any clarification from instructors should be posted on Slack under the channel **#final-review** such that all students have access to the same clarification. 


### EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. Evidence of understanding of the underlying concepts related to the question. Can you answer the "why?" where asked?  

1. Your answer should be within a sentence or two.  If there's a word limit, please follow it. You may download a VSCode extension which displays a word count in the status bar at the bottom for markdown (.md) files. Note the previous word count and then note what is the additional count because of your answer, the difference of the two readings giving you the word count.

1. How complete is your answer and/or your code.  Code is complete if it can handle all possible inputs, e.g. user error.

1. Have you annotated your code with comments so it is reasonably understandable?  Have you indented your code appropriately? Very long comments are not needed. The comments should be sufficient for an experienced developer to follow your solution.

1. Does your code work, where applicable?


### PASSING CRITERIA & SCORING STRATEGIES

1. 70% of overall score is needed for overall success. 

1. Some credit is given for partially complete or partly correct answers as well. Hence do not skip questions.

1. Do attempt the practical portion and push it, even if it doesn't work. Even non-working practical portion may attract enough credit to put you over the passing mark.

1. Do not blindly copy code from a solution you may have found. If you do use copied code, use brief comments to explain what is going on. It MUST demonstrate your understanding of what's happening. No credit is given for the code, if the code is not explained using comments.

1. Passing grade is required for you to receive a ACC Software Bootcamp certificate. It also is needed for ACC instructors to provide employment references. If you do not succeed, you may retake the exam after suitable preparation.


### HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU HAVE TO COMPLETE THIS REVIEW?

1. You have the entire review day to complete. Please commit and push before end of the calendar day. Please try a test add/commit/push after answering a few questions so you don't run into git issues at the end.

1. IF you are not done, please push your incomplete answers. You may later add to your answers upto the end of the next day. These late answers would be considered if you do not get above the passing mark.
