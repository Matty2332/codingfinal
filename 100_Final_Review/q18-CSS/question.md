1.Minify your CSS-this will compress your CSS file into a newer file with minimal white space using tools available on the internet to assist in compression

3.Put CSS at top and JS at bottom-CSS loaded before the rest of the page will help to speed things up since it is a smaller size than JS and effect the website speed

4.Reduce unnecessary code-check for redundant or duplicate code which can be done manually or by using tools available online
