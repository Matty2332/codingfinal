The following questions have equal weightage. Each answer MUST be completed within 150 words:

1. Describe pseudo-elements and discuss what are they used for?
CSS Pseudo elements are keywords added to selectors that help you style specific parts of particular elements.

1. What does `* { box-sizing: border-box; }` do? What are its advantages?
It streamlines setting making everything fit together and easier to control. Gives guidelines for box-setting.  It sets the width and height and knowing that border and padding are included.
 
1. What’s the difference between inline and inline-block?
Inline elements don’t start on a new line, they appear on the same line as the content and tags beside them. This will make a block out of text in the same like as another text so you can style it individually.
Inline-block elements are similar to inline elements, except they can have padding and margins added on all four sides. You’ll have to declare display: inline-block in your CSS code. Use this to make things like a navigation bar.


1. What are the different ways to visually hide content (and make it available only for screen readers)?
Tell CSS to display nothing or make something hidden.Or set literal content to 0 pixels so whatever is displayed in HTML has no value to be displayed.
Another way is to move visible content off of the visible screen or make a hidden class in HTML and adapt it in CSS to move it off of the screen.
