## Question: 

Does the HTML below trigger a HTTP GET request for the picture file, when the page first loads?  

Hint: you may put it in a sample page, load it and check out the network tab in the Devtools.

(Please view the images below in a md previewer in VSCode, or on github.com)

Case 1:
    <img src="mypic.jpg" style="visibility: hidden" alt="">

Case 2:
    <img src="mypic.jpg" style="display:none" alt="">
